# Air-Pollution-Risk-Assessment

This project is a GIS analysis to map air pollutant concentrations, analyze spatial patterns, and evaluate implications for vulnerable populations

## Aim

This project aims to assess air pollution exposure in selected southeastern Georgia counties. 
By leveraging GIS techniques, the study maps air pollutant concentrations, analyzes spatial patterns, and evaluates implications for vulnerable populations. These assessments are critical for informing policymakers, urban planners, and public health officials to develop targeted interventions and policies aimed at mitigating air pollution and protecting public health


## Resource used
ArcGIS
Air Quality dataset (from EPA)
Population and administrative boundary dataset (from Cemsu)

## Conclusion
There are more TRI stations in 2010 (143) than in 2020 (109).
There is a reduction in the number of people exposed from 2010 to 2020, but the spatial distribution is a concern. 
Bulloch county seem to be more at risk than Effingham( Wood product from statesboro).The hyundai plant in Bryan county seems to be introducing more pollutant (Fabricated metal). Population is not entirely correlated with the population at risk. There is a possible indication of Covid.
